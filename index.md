Adam’s story begins in Lafayette, LA where he was born and raised. Beginning with Legos as a child, Adam has always enjoyed piecing a conceptual idea into a real-world application. He enjoyed fast paced sports such as hockey which he played for over a decade and more recently has began training in mixed martial arts. Adam believes that doing hard things promotes growth as a person. Adam has failed and succeeded throughout his professional career. He believes that it is the journey that matters, not the destination. Adam is a father, husband, professional, and a loyal friend. 

Upon graduating college in 2011, Adam utilized his Petroleum Engineering degree to begin his professional journey with Chevron as a Petroleum Engineer. Throughout his tenure with Chevron, Adam had six roles throughout three different business units spanning from Louisiana to Canada. In addition to his technical work as an engineer, Adam quickly became the front-end user Champion for creating workflows with new software that were being adopted by the business. After seven years of service with Chevron, Adam moved his family to his hometown of Lafayette, LA and challenged himself to become an entrepreneur. 
 
After moving back to his hometown, Adam wrote multiple business plans, scouted the local business opportunities, and decided to own and operate a local downtown pub called Jefferson Street Pub. On the first day Adam opened the doors to the public, he made a point to introduce himself to the local patrons and earn the respect of the employees. He worked every job in the business from doorman, barback, bartender, chef, dishwasher, social media director, and manager. Adam leads through example and communicates with consideration of his audience. Adam had the opportunity to interact with and serve thousands of patrons. As a strong believer in supporting the person next to him, Adam ensured that his team had the attitude and aptitude to succeed in their roles each and every day. He implemented team meetings before and after shifts to ensure that lessons learned were passed along and the team would continue to improve.

Upon reviewing the business landscape in downtown Lafayette and global circumstances, Adam sold his business and transitioned into an Asset Integrity Engineering role with Intertek in Broussard, LA. Adam was able to quickly learn and demonstrate his detail oriented technical skills as a technical consultant ensuring quality reporting of asset integrity issues on deep water oil and gas facilities. As the newest Engineer in the group, Adam wrote detailed workflow notes and onboarded two technical consultants, acting as their mentor.

With a desire to transition careers into a long-time personal interest of computer programming, Adam saw an opportunity to apply to the Perficient Bright Paths Program. After completing the interview process, Adam was subsequently accepted into the 16 week coding bootcamp.
