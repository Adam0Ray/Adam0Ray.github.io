Throughout his tenure with Chevron, Adam had six roles throughout three different business units spanning from Louisiana to Canada. In addition to his technical work as an engineer, Adam quickly became the front-end user Champion for creating workflows with new software that were being adopted by the business. After seven years of service with Chevron, Adam moved his family to his hometown of Lafayette, LA and challenged himself to become an entrepreneur. 
 
After moving back to his hometown, Adam wrote multiple business plans, scouted the local business opportunities, and decided to own and operate a local downtown pub called Jefferson Street Pub. On the first day Adam opened the doors to the public, he made a point to introduce himself to the local patrons and earn the respect of the employees. He worked every job in the business from doorman, barback, bartender, chef, dishwasher, social media director, and manager. Adam leads through example and communicates with consideration of his audience. Adam had the opportunity to interact with and serve thousands of patrons. As a strong believer in supporting the person next to him, Adam ensured that his team had the attitude and aptitude to succeed in their roles each and every day. He implemented team meetings before and after shifts to ensure that lessons learned were passed along and the team would continue to improve.

Upon reviewing the business landscape in downtown Lafayette and global circumstances, Adam sold his business and transitioned into an Asset Integrity Engineering role with Intertek in Broussard, LA. Adam was able to quickly learn and demonstrate his detail oriented technical skills as a technical consultant ensuring quality reporting of asset integrity issues on deep water oil and gas facilities.
